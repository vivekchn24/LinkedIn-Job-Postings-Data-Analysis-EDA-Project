# **LinkedIn-Job-Postings-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project**

- This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on job postings extracted from LinkedIn between 2023 and 2024, aiming to uncover trends in hiring practices, in-demand roles, and skill requirements across industries.

## **üíº LinkedIn-Job-Postings-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project**

- Every day, thousands of companies and individuals turn to LinkedIn in search of talent. This dataset contains a nearly comprehensive record of 124,000+ job postings listed in 2023 and 2024. Each individual posting contains dozens of valuable attributes for both postings and companies, including the title, job description, salary, location, application URL, and work-types (remote, contract, etc), in addition to separate files containing the benefits, skills, and industries associated with each posting. The majority of jobs are also linked to a company, which are all listed in another csv file containing attributes such as the company description, headquarters location, and number of employees, and follower count.

## **üìå Key Objectives :-**

- Cleaned and structured job posting data to remove duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies
- Analyzed postings by job title, location, company, employment type, and experience level
- Extracted and visualized trending skills, technologies, and tools mentioned in job descriptions
- Performed keyword frequency analysis and sentiment scoring on job descriptions

## **üîß Tools & Technologies Used :-**

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) Libraries
- Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis

## **üìå Key Steps Performed In EDA Analysis**

1. Data Cleaning
   - Handling missing values
   - Dropping irrelevant or redundant columns
   - Formatting and type conversion

2. Univariate Analysis
   - Distributions of Views, max_salary, min_salary, etc.

3. Bivariate Analysis
   - Job Title vs max_salary, min_salary, etc.

4. Multivariate Analysis
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Factors affecting loan defaults

5. Insights & Conclusions
   - Summarized key findings with visual charts
   - Business recommendations

## **üéØ Outcome :-**

- This project demonstrates practical use of EDA in understanding real-world hiring data, helping job seekers and analysts align with current market demands. It also shows how data can guide career decisions and workforce trends.

## **üìå LinkedIn-Job-Postings-Data-EDA-Project ‚Äì Key Insights & Recommendations:-**

1) Focus on Sales Manager roles and highlight Senior Expert Level salaries.

2) Prioritize Full-Time and Remote-Allowed jobs to attract maximum applications.

3) Mention Base Salary clearly to improve candidate interest and trust.

4) Post jobs on Mondays, especially around dates like 15th‚Äì19th, to get higher visibility.

5) Offer Yearly or Monthly salary pay periods instead of Weekly or Biweekly.

6) Prefer OffsiteApply and ComplexOnsiteApply methods for job applications.

7) Post jobs more in January, February, December, and April for better reach.

8) Senior Expert Level jobs earn the highest minimum and maximum salaries.

9) Jobs with Not-Mentioned Compensation still perform well, but Base Salary detail attracts better candidates.

## **üìé This project does not include business insights. It is intended for practice only.**

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:-**

- The code, analysis, and outputs in this project are not to be copied and used elsewhere, including in resumes or other projects that's why i attached jupyter notebook pdf only.The goal of this project is to practice and improve my skills, not to provide ready-to-use solutions.

-->Feel free to refer to the attached Jupyter notebook PDF for practice and understanding the concepts. This project is meant to showcase my personal learning journey through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and you can use it as a reference to practice and enhance your skills in data analysis.

## **üìå Disclaimer:**

-This EDA project is created purely for learning and practice purposes; hence, I‚Äôve shared only the PDF versions of the Jupyter Notebook and PowerPoint to maintain originality and avoid direct copy-paste.
